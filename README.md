- 👋 Hi, I’m @al3xsus
- 👀 I’m interested in many things. Particularly in Node, Python, React, data visualization, infographics, SPA, full-stack development, cool CSS tricks.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing - I'm a kinda lazy pig, I just like to watch some Youtube coding videos and sometimes repeat them. Monkey see - monkey do.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something interesting, like robotic process automation, or data visualization, or infographics, or maybe even 3D.
- 📫 How to reach me - easier way is to write email: al3xsus@pm.me.
